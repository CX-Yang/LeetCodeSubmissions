Return the wealth that the richest customer has.
A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts.

public class Solution {
    public int MaximumWealth(int[][] accounts) {
        int product = 0;
        
        //traverse through all arrays and thier values
        for(int i = 0; i < accounts.Length; i++){
            int temp = 0;
            
            //add array content
            for(int j = 0; j < accounts[i].Length; j++){
                temp += accounts[i][j];
            }
            
            //save the higher of the wealth
            product = Math.Max(product,temp);
        }
        
        return product;
